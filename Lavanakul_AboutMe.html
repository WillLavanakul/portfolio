                            <p style="font-size:15px;" class="thumbnail maintheme3">I have always had a love for building things, inside and outside of a computer or a program. My plans and goals would have to include familiarizing myself with programming and many other types of engineering. My main goal is to be a computer or software engineer. Electronic parts and computers always have been interesting for me. I love to play games a long with figuring out what each setting does or how different components affect the way a computer runs. Sometimes I find myself reading up on infornation regarding computer technology and even sometimes exploring different builds for computers.
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-size:15px;" class="thumbnail maintheme3">Strengths that I have are that I am persistent. When I want to figure something out I can spend many hours trying. This is true for a lot of the things that I do in life: projects, gymnastics, art, curiosity over computers, and the sorts. I also take big challenges and always find it a great experience to try and challenge myself. When I see something difficult  trying to be done, I am probably going to look into it or try to do it. I am also very alert. When working on projects and trying to fix certain issues, I am usually the one looking and finding a lot of problems. This is extremely useful when debugging code and working with finer details of technology. Regardless of having the solution or not, identifying the problem is the first step of fixing something.</p>
                            <p style="font-size:15px;" class="thumbnail maintheme3">I have achieved a lot over the past years. I am an aspiring gymnast, artist, and computer engineer. Starting off with Gymnastics, I became the 2015 level 8 Regional Champion scoring high above other competitors along with being the consistent Pommel Horse champion during most of the competitions throughout the season. In 2016 and 2017 I went on to win 2 national titles on the Pommel Horse and qualified for All around finals in 2017. I also qualified to the Regional Team Select camp both years to train with Olympic level coaches. For some of my work experience I have done a number of things. Starting off, I have worked at gymnastics competitions. I have learned a lot of how to handle cash, snacks, and selling to customers. I have also gone and participated in many community event jobs.</p>
