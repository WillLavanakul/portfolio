My specific role in the project was to build the machine, revise documentation, and help with the Netlogo simulation. A problem we encountered while building the machine was that it was too unstable. We designed 2 side pillars that would stabilize the machine. Another problem we ran into was that our resulting gear ratio was about 1:4, which meant that the driven gear was spinning 4 times faster than the driving gear. However, when we tested the winch, it was too weak and did not move. We then moved on to change the gear ratio into having more torque, and testing which was better. We realized that the winch failed to lift the weight not because of the lack of torque, but that the gears were not meshing properly, and they were forced together because of the failure of the Fischertechnik pieces on the stand to exactly accommodate the gear size. To solve this, we chained the last two gears together and changed the gear train to higher torque. There was a great deal in teamwork. Many days we would find ourselves having 3 of the 4 group members present. This would mean we would have to work harder and more efficiently. I paired up with another team member to fix all the problems with the machine along with working on the NetLogo program.</p>

                            <p style="font-size:15px;" class="thumbnail">In this project, we had to made a game using the drag and drop coding software known as MIT App Inventor. The game had to have progression, a level of playability, a way to win, a way to lose, and most importantly it had to work. At the beginning days of our project we first mainly talked about our design process. We really needed to do this in detail because if we didn’t, the steps we’d take might not have been in synch and have caused multiple version issues. We could have mis matching variables, have written the same code, have written something we planned to not use, etc. We did this for the first 1 or 2 days. It was essential in developing this app without any tutorial or guideline. After the days of planning, we started to plan the layout of our app in app inventor. I made the images while Danny made the layout of the main title screen and character selection screen. After editing and cropping the images we then imported them into app inventor. We ran into a couple issues with certain things, as we couldn't rotate the buttons so that player 2 would have been able to sit opposite of player 1. We ended up just making the game played from one view to make everything easier. We proceeded to start working on the other phases of the code. This started with brainstorming what the abilities were for the bawler. We coded all abilities and went to each screen that had the brawler and made the code. We went to duelist and dit eh same thing. This was about when the first beta walk was happening. We couldn't get the app to compile so we limited the app to 2 heroes, effectively getting rid of more than half of the 18 screens we initially had. From there, we already had the 2 characters set and debugged. The app worked bugged free with a guide to the abilities and the rules of the game.</p>

We centered our app around sports scholarships and all around simplifying what students needed to do in order to apply for schools. Our development process started off with a lot of prototyping in proto.io and a lot of brainstorming. After the brainstorming process we got into Android Studio and worked through coding the beginning phases of our app. Unfourtunately, the computer we were working on broke and we could not recover the application data so we had to start from scratch. We tried to get back to where we were as fast as possible while keeping the same guidelines in place. We ended up settling for an app that demonstrated simplifying navigation towards contactig and finding information for colleges. We used a simple class and made a library of 4 different schools to demonstrate this. It work cleanly with no bugs.</p>
